## Stock Website

This is a financial website where users can register & login to their own account to search, buy and sell stocks.

Each account made is a "demo" account with $10,000 to trade stocks. There is a portfolio page where people can view the stocks they have and how much money they have left in the account.

I used Python, Flask, HTML & Bootstrap to develop this application as part of the Harvard CS50 Introduction to Computer Science with Python course.

The fundamental chasis of this application was already coded and my task was to add features such as the login system.
